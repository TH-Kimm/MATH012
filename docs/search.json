    "text": "What is R?\nR is a versatile computer program that enables a wide range of statistical calculations and data analysis. Developed and maintained largely through voluntary contributions from statisticians globally, R is a free and open-source tool available on most operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.\nBeyond statistical analysis, R also excels in creating graphics and functions as a full-fledged programming language. In this series of labs, we will only begin to explore the extensive capabilities that R offers."

    "text": "How can we run R?\nThe base R environment is always accessible, but most users prefer to work with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for a more user-friendly interface. RStudio, for example, is one of the most popular IDEs today.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough you can download and run R locally on your system, it’s not necessary for our labs, as they can be completed directly within self-contained webpages. We recommend sticking to the content provided on the lab webpages to familiarize yourself with the syntax. Once you feel comfortable with the language, you can easily run R on your laptop."

Urine, beyond being unpleasant, reacts with chlorine to produce toxic chemicals like trichloramine, a common cause of skin irritation for swimmers. Researchers found that the artificial sweetener ACE, which passes through the body unmetabolized and in consistent amounts, can be used to measure the amount of urine in a pool by analyzing ACE concentrations. Below is a list of ACE concentrations (measured in ng/L) from 15 different pools in the US: \\[ 438,  211,  640,   85,   83,  350,  138,   49,  465,  489,55, 1086,   71, 1058,  247.\\]\n\n\n\nIn R, create a vector of these data and give it an appropriate name. (Uncomment and use the data.)\nWhat is the mean ACE concentration in these 15 pools?\nSince urine contains an average ACE of 4000 ng/ml, we can obtain the urin concentration (ml/L) by dividing each value by 4000 from the ACE concentration data.

As depicted in the movie Moneyball (2011), the use of baseball statistics and analytics to measure player and team performance has become widespread. While numerous baseball analytics are used in the field, we will focus on some of the key statistics that measure the offensive and defensive capabilities of MLB teams:\n\n01. Team:  Name of the team \n02. Win_P: Winning Percentage, \"# of Wins\"/ \"Total # of games\".\n03. RPG:   Runs per Game, the average number of runs a team or player scores in each game. \n04. BA:    Batting Average, \"the # of times a batter hits a ball and reaches the base\"/\"the # of at bats by a batter\".   \n05. OPS:   On-base plus slugging, the sum of on-base percentage and slugging percentage. \n06. ORPG:  Opponent Runs per Game, the runs per game by the opponent.   \n07. ERA:   Earned Run Average, the number of earned runs a pitcher allows per nine innings.    \n08. WHIP:  Walks And Hits Per Inning Pitched, the statistic shows how well a pitcher has kept runners off the basepaths, one of his main goals.\n\nIn the data set, the variable \\(\\texttt{Win\\_P}\\) measures a MLB team’s performance throughout the 2023 season. For offensive capability, we can use the variables \\(\\texttt{RPG}\\), \\(\\texttt{BA}\\), and \\(\\texttt{OPS}\\); whereas, for defensive capability, we can use \\(\\texttt{ORPG}\\), \\(\\texttt{ERA}\\), and \\(\\texttt{WHIP}\\).",
