    "text": "What is R?\nR is a versatile computer program that enables a wide range of statistical calculations and data analysis. Developed and maintained largely through voluntary contributions from statisticians globally, R is a free and open-source tool available on most operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.\nBeyond statistical analysis, R also excels in creating graphics and functions as a full-fledged programming language. In this series of labs, we will only begin to explore the extensive capabilities that R offers."

    "section": "How can we run R?",
    "text": "How can we run R?\nThe base R environment is always accessible, but most users prefer to work with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for a more user-friendly interface. RStudio, for example, is one of the most popular IDEs today.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough you can download and run R locally on your system, it’s not necessary for our labs, as they can be completed directly within self-contained webpages. We recommend sticking to the content provided on the lab webpages to familiarize yourself with the syntax. Once you feel comfortable with the language, you can easily run R on your laptop."

Feel free to discuss the questions with fellow students, and don’t hesitate to ask the TA for help!"
