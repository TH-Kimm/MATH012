    "text": "What is R?\nR is a versatile computer program that enables a wide range of statistical calculations and data analysis. Developed and maintained largely through voluntary contributions from statisticians globally, R is a free and open-source tool available on most operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.\nBeyond statistical analysis, R also excels in creating graphics and functions as a full-fledged programming language. In this series of labs, we will only begin to explore the extensive capabilities that R offers."

    "text": "How can we run R?\nThe base R environment is always accessible, but most users prefer to work with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for a more user-friendly interface. RStudio, for example, is one of the most popular IDEs today.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough you can download and run R locally on your system, it’s not necessary for our labs, as they can be completed directly within self-contained webpages. We recommend sticking to the content provided on the lab webpages to familiarize yourself with the syntax. Once you feel comfortable with the language, you can easily run R on your laptop."

    "text": "A vector is a sequence of finite elements and serves as the basic object in R. For example, a single number like “3” is considered a vector of length 1. It is a highly relevant object from a statistical perspective, as it allows us to store variables in vector objects. To create a vector, we use the \\(\\texttt{c()}\\) function, where the name is an abbreviation of “combine”. For example, suppose we need to create a vector for a set of elements representing weight observations.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAs learned, we can assign a descriptive variable name to the vector:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nRemark: We can condense the double line process (saving and printing) into a single line by wrapping the assignment process with the \\(\\texttt{print()}\\) function.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf we want to create an integer vector, then the \\(\\texttt{:}\\) operator or \\(\\texttt{seq()}\\) function offer efficient solutions.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOf course, we can combine two vectors by using the \\(\\texttt{c()}\\) function again.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nOne of the powerful features of vectors in R is the ability to perform the same calculation on every element with a single command, i.e., element-wise operation. For example, when converting weights from pounds to kilograms, we can multiply 0.454. This operation can be applied to all the numbers in a vector simultaneously:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe operation between two vectors is also element-wise in R.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nTo access a specific element in a vector, you add square brackets after the vector name and place the index of the desired element inside the brackets.

For our discussion, let’s suppose our interest lies in the population mean height, denoted as \\(\\mu\\), for all Lehigh students. As this value is unknown, we need to collect a sample for inference. For our purpose, let’s utilize the Height variable in our class survey data.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFor the following questions, let us presume the assumptions for the hypothesis testings are satisfied.\nFirst of all, let say we are interested in whether the population average height is greater than 66 inches, and wish to statistically confirm this claim under 0.05 significance level. The notation for population average or population mean is the Greek letter \\(\\mu\\). So, let us write what we want to show in alternative hypothesis \\(\\mu &gt; 66\\) and the null hypothesis is just the opposite \\(\\mu \\le 66\\): \\[\nH_0:\\; \\mu \\le 66 \\;\\;\\text{vs.}\\;\\;H_a:\\; \\mu &gt; 66.\n\\] Note that the general notation for the reference value 66 is \\(\\mu_0\\). This test is called a right-tailed test since we want to show the target parameter \\(\\mu\\) is in right hand side the reference value \\(\\mu_0\\).\nNow, let us explore our data vector \\(X\\) and record necessary components.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere, the sample size is large \\(n\\ge 30\\), so we can use the \\(z\\) test statistic: \\[\nZ^*=\\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\n\\] In particular, the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) will be replaced by its sample version that we calculated previously (since we have a large sample size).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOnce we have the test statistic, then it’s time to calculate the corresponding p-value. In z-test, the p-value is essentially one of the tail-probabilities on the standard normal distribution. Since this test is a right-tailed test, we calculate the right-tail probability. In R, the function \\(\\texttt{pnorm()}\\) provides us the left-tail probability, so \\[\n\\text{p-value}=P[Z&gt;z^*]\\stackrel{\\textsf{R}}{=}\\texttt{1-pnorm(z.star)}.\n\\]\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that a small p-value indicates a strong evidence against the Null Hypothesis in favor of Alternative Hypothesis, so we can reject the null hypothesis. How small is small enough? We determine this through the comparison with the significance level.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this case, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Interpretation would follow given the context of the problem:\n“Given the significance level 0.05, there is not enough evidence that the population average height of all Lehigh students is greater than 66 inches.”.\nNow, let us consider another population parameter: the population average height of all Lehigh students whose favorite professional sports is NBA. Regarding this target parameter, we wish to perform exactly the same right-tailed test. Let us explore the data.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe need to note that the sample size of new data set is only 27. Since the sample size is not large enough we have to use the \\(t\\)-test. (Assume the population distribution is normal.) \\[\nT^*=\\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFor the p-value calculation, we now need to compute one of the tail probabilities of the t-distribution with the corresponding degrees of freedom (\\(n-1\\)). The t-table we have used in class does not provide the exact probability, but the R function \\(\\texttt{pt()}\\) can be used for the exact computation. Since this is still right-tailed test: \\[\n\\text{p-value}=P[T&gt;t^*]\\stackrel{\\textsf{R}}{=}\\texttt{1-pt(t.star,n-1)}.\n\\]\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that we can reject the null hypothesis in this sub-group analysis. Therefore, “Given the significance level 0.05, there is not enough evidence that the population average height of all Lehigh students who loves NBA is greater than 66 inches.”."

    "text": "Variable Names\nWhen defining variables (or objects), the choice of variable names in programming is crucial. Selecting clear and descriptive names for variables is vital for several reasons:\n\nReadability and Understandability: Clear and descriptive variable names enhance the readability and comprehension of your code.\nMaintainability and Debugging: Thoughtfully named variables simplify code maintenance and debugging processes.\nCollaboration: In a team setting, consistent and clear variable naming conventions are crucial for effective collaboration.\nSelf-Documentation: Meaningful variable names serve as self-documentation, making the code more intuitive.\nCode Reusability: Adopting good variable naming practices supports greater code reusability.\n\nSometimes, clear naming requires using multiple words in a variable name, but spaces are not allowed. A common approach is to separate words with underscores, as demonstrated previously, such as \\(\\texttt{\\color{brown}{morning\\_temperature\\_august}}\\).\n\nExample\nLet us assign relevant names to the following variables:\n\n\n\n#\nFeature\nValue\n\n\n\n\n1\nBody temperature in Fahrenheit\n98\n\n\n2\nNumber of shoes for Sam\n11\n\n\n3\nWeight of a elephant in pounds\n12,050\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",
